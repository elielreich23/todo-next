## 🛡️ Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**: 
   - Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/register` with user details.
   - Backend hashes the password, stores the user, and returns a **JWT token**.

2. **User Login**: 
   - Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with valid credentials.
   - If successful, backend responds with a **JWT token**.

3. **Authenticated Requests**: 
   - Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for all authenticated routes (`/api/tasks`).

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- **Task Prioritization**: Add a feature for users to prioritize tasks by deadline or importance.
- **Real-time Sync**: Implement **WebSockets** for real-time task updates across users.
- **Unit Testing**: Add **Jest** and **Cypress** for comprehensive unit and integration testing.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode toggle for better accessibility.
